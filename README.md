1. Problem I wanted to solve

: Last November, there was a University Ice Hockey League for 5 korean univs : Yosei, Korea, Kwangwoon, Hanyang, and Kyunghee. I've played for Kyunghee until 2020, So I watched them play, not alone but with two old-teammates, who was not competing in the game because of injury.

They were writing something during the whole game, so I asked them what they are doing.

They said, Head coach gave them a role to write down 1- every shots in each period, 2- player who made that shot in our team. 

And I thought, "I think I can make more convenient way than writing-with-hand which can even generate some good-to-looking datas..." 

So I worked with it.

2. What program does

: You can 1- register players who is on your team, 2- Record the shots with just dragging the jersy over the Ice image, 3- Get shot datas like : How many shots happened, who shot how many of them, what location did the shots appeared, ratio of shots made by each players on the team.

3. Worked with

: HTML, CSS, Javascript, with some bootstrap for components & plotly for graphs.
Used Local Stoarge to save player info, shot records.
